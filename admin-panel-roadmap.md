## Getting Started

To begin implementing this roadmap:

1. Start with Priority 1 items to enable basic operations
2. Implement technical improvements alongside feature development
3. Move to Priority 2 once basic operations are stable
4. Implement Priority 3 features as the business grows

This phased approach will allow you to start operations quickly while building toward a comprehensive admin system. 

## Next Steps

Based on our progress, the next priority should be:
1. Complete the vehicle availability calendar
2. Begin implementation of Routes Management
3. Continue enhancing the driver management features
