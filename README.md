## **6. Deployment & Environments**

1. **Development**  
   - Local environment using `vite dev`.  
   - Supabase local instance or staging environment.
2. **Staging**  
   - Deployed automatically from a “staging” branch on Netlify or Vercel.  
   - Environment variables set for testing PayMongo sandbox keys.
3. **Production**  
   - Auto-deployed from the main branch after tests pass.  
   - Uses production PayMongo keys, with alerts set for payment failures.

---

## **7. Security & Compliance**

- **Data Protection**  
  - Follow best practices for storing and transmitting personal data (encryption at rest and in transit).  
  - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in Supabase.  
  - Enforce strong password policies or offer social login with secure providers.
- **Payment Compliance**  
  - Align with PayMongo’s guidelines and local regulations to ensure compliance with PCI DSS standards.

## **8. Performance & Monitoring**

- **Performance Goals**  
  - Page load: Under 3 seconds on a 3G/4G connection.  
  - Transaction processing: Under 2 seconds average for booking flow.
- **Monitoring**  
  - Use built-in logs from Supabase and deployment platforms.  
  - Set up error tracking (Sentry or similar) to log exceptions in real-time.
- **Scaling Strategy**  
  - Horizontal scaling through Netlify/Vercel for the frontend.  
  - Supabase auto-scaling or manual upgrading to handle increasing load.

---

## **9. Testing & QA**

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Use Jest or Vitest for component and utility testing.  
2. **Integration Tests**  
   - End-to-end tests with Cypress or Playwright to cover booking flows and payment scenarios.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**  
   - All core user flows (signup, booking, payment) must pass before new features are merged.  
   - Zero critical errors in staging before production deployment.

---

## **10. Timeline & Milestones**
